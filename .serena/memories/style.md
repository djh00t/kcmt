- Code style: Enforced by Black formatting and isort import ordering; Ruff used for linting. Type hints throughout (dataclasses, explicit typing). Modules use ASCII strings; docstrings summarize functionality. CLI prints use ANSI colours; keep comments concise and meaningful.
- Design patterns: Config loaded via dataclass `Config`; Git interactions encapsulated in `GitRepo`; commit flow orchestrated by `KlingonCMTWorkflow` with per-file diff staging, concurrency via ThreadPoolExecutor. Providers follow driver pattern (`BaseDriver`, `OpenAIDriver`, etc.). Lazy imports in `kcmt/__init__.py` to avoid heavy side effects.
